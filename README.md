Hey 👋

<h1>About me</h1>
<p>I see you found my GitHub. This is where all my code lives, code that does not quite work yet... but it will someday. I am thrilled to commit more time developing Open Source Software. It's one thing I planned to spend more time with! Help me do that. Thank you very much. Let me know if you want to get in touch with me. </p>
